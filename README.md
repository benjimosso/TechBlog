# TECH BLOG APP
# DESCRIPTION
### In this assigment I created a TechBlog Application. 
### This is some of the requirements:
    - I am presented with the homepage, which includes existing blog posts if any have been posted; navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard; and the option to log in.
    - I see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to log out.
    - I am taken to the homepage and presented with existing blog posts that include the post title and the date created.
    - I am presented with the post title, contents, post creator’s username, and date created for that post and have the option to leave a comment.
    - I enter a comment and click on the submit button while signed in then the comment is saved and the post is updated to display the comment, the comment creator’s username, and the date created.
    - I click on the dashboard option in the navigation then I am taken to the dashboard and presented with any blog posts I have already created and the option to add a new blog post.
